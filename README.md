TTechnology used: 

Language - Python 3.8 

Web framework - Streamlit 

AI model - Google Gemini 2.5 Flash API  

Database - Google Cloud Firestore API 

This project proposes the development of a virtual travel planning assistant. I used Gemini 2.5 Flash API as an LLM and built a website using Python with the Streamlit as a main web framework and Google Cloud Firestore for data storage and management. 

Users will be able to upload relevant travel documents, specify destinations and activities, and receive assistance, including suggestions, reservation requirements, and personalized recommendations.
